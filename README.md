# DopUnderscore
Data Oriented Programming (DOP) using the underscore-java library

In this repository I am starting by setting up the structure and files 
that I will be suing to experiment with DOP.

A few weeks ago I watched an ACM webinar that dealt with DOP.
It called my attention so I decided to get the associated book
written by the presenter. The book concentrates on Javascript
but the author claims that it can be used with most programming
languages.

This repo willl be updated as I make progress reading the associated
book and experimenting.

If interested in my comments associated with this repo I invite you
to read the following post in my blog:

Enjoy;
